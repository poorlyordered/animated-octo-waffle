# Gryyk-47 Greenfield Roadmap

## Vision

Build Gryyk-47 as a corporation command operating system for EVE Online: a data-driven loop that helps a commander see numbers, evaluate opportunity, understand people, and turn decisions into auditable automation.

## Architecture Direction

- Frontend: command center first, chat second. Chat remains useful, but core work happens through dashboards, briefs, queues, and decision records.
- Backend: short request/response APIs for reads and user-approved commands.
- Workers: long-running research, enrichment, summarization, and sync jobs run outside Netlify timeouts.
- Storage: MongoDB remains acceptable for operational documents, research briefs, requests, events, and decision records.
- AI: AI processors write structured outputs with source references, confidence, prompt/model metadata, and status.
- Integrations: EVE SSO, ESI, OvernightDesk, MongoDB, and future agent platforms enter through typed adapters.

## Operating Domains

1. Numbers
   - Corporation financial health
   - Asset and logistics visibility
   - Market and industry opportunities
   - Activity and operational cadence

2. Opportunity
   - Official EVE news and patch changes
   - Strategic implications from research briefs
   - Recruiting and corporation growth openings
   - Risk and timing windows

3. People
   - Member profiles and activity
   - Roles, trust, delegation, and onboarding
   - Social/operational graph
   - Retention and leadership workload

## First Milestones

### M0: Project Foundation

Goal: establish constitution, roadmap, repo structure, and development rules.

Deliverables:

- Spec Kit initialized
- Constitution ratified
- Greenfield roadmap captured
- Initial product architecture decision recorded
- First feature candidate selected

### M1: Command Brief MVP - Complete

Goal: show the commander the latest structured state of the corporation across numbers, opportunity, and people.

Delivered capabilities:

- Load latest processed research brief from MongoDB
- Show status of background intelligence jobs
- Present source count, confidence, model, and createdAt
- Surface recommended actions and watchlist
- Make missing data explicit

Validation:

- Spec: `specs/001-command-brief-mvp`
- Implementation committed in `c962920 feat: implement command brief mvp`
- Local validation covered lint, typecheck, tests, and production build

### M2: Decision Record Loop - Complete

Goal: let the commander turn a recommendation into a tracked decision.

Delivered capabilities:

- Save decision records
- Link decisions to source briefs and data snapshots
- Track status: proposed, approved, delegated, done, rejected
- Capture rationale and expected result
- Preserve explicit approval boundaries for player-impacting decisions
- Normalize existing `strategic_decisions` documents while writing new normalized records

Validation:

- Spec: `specs/002-decision-record-loop`
- Implementation committed in `f9420ba feat: implement decision record loop`
- Quickstart write-flow validation committed in `f940034 test: validate decision record quickstart target`
- Local validation covered lint, typecheck, tests, production build, and an isolated MongoDB write-flow check against `gryyk47_greenfield_test`

### M3: Automation Queue

Goal: model automation as auditable hands and feet.

Candidate capabilities:

- Queue tasks for workers or external agents
- Show status, owner, input, output, failure, and retry metadata
- Require approval for player-impacting actions

### M4: People Operating Layer

Goal: support recruiting, onboarding, delegation, and member health.

Candidate capabilities:

- Member profile summaries
- Activity and role views
- Onboarding tasks
- Leadership follow-up queue

## Near-Term Recommendation

Proceed to M3: Automation Queue.

The next slice should turn approved decision records into auditable work items without executing player-impacting actions automatically. This builds on M1's grounded command briefs and M2's approval boundary while keeping long-running work outside Netlify request/response paths.

Recommended M3 scope:

- Define an `automation_queue` contract for queued work, status, owner, input, output, failure, retry metadata, and provenance.
- Add a command surface that can queue a task from an approved decision record.
- Prevent unapproved player-impacting decisions from creating queue entries.
- Keep queue processing out of the web request path; the MVP should create and inspect queue records only.
- Add validation against an isolated MongoDB test database before enabling any real worker integration.
